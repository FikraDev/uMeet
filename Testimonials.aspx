                    Our relationship started with the word hi and she answered what's 
                        your story and we started conversation. Within our first convo she 
                        told me I was going to be hers and as we begin to talk and video chat non stop. 
                        We grew closer and closer. And one day I felt like I couldn't live without 
                        her no more and I asked her will she marry me and she said yes.
